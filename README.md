# H1 Hello this is my favorite series
## H2 The favorite series that i watched is "The Book of Blood"
The Books of Blood were published, they shocked and frightened millions of people around the world
 … this film dares to open those pages again.” These are the words that start Hulu’s very loose adaptation of Clive Barker’s
 “Books of Blood,” based on one of the most influential series of short stories ever put to the page. While it may seem unfair
 to compare an adaptation to its excellent source, the creators here lay down that gauntlet right from the beginning,
 and then fail to meet their own standard.
